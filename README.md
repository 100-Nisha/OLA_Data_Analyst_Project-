## 🎯 Objectives

✦ Analyze ride booking performance and trends  
✦ Track successful, cancelled, and incomplete rides  
✦ Understand customer and driver ratings  
✦ Identify top customers and vehicle types  
✦ Visualize KPIs using Power BI dashboards 

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

✦ **SQL** – Data querying and analysis  
✦ **Power BI** – Interactive dashboards & data visualization  
✦ **CSV Dataset** – Source data  
✦ **Microsoft Excel** – Data validation & preprocessing  

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset contains detailed ride-level booking information with the following columns:

✦ Date  
✦ Time  
✦ Booking_ID  
✦ Booking_Status  
✦ Customer_ID  
✦ Vehicle_Type  
✦ Pickup_Location  
✦ Drop_Location  
✦ V_TAT (Vehicle Turnaround Time)  
✦ C_TAT (Customer Turnaround Time)  
✦ Cancelled_Rides_by_Customer  
✦ Cancelled_Rides_by_Driver  
✦ Incomplete_Rides  
✦ Incomplete_Rides_Reason  
✦ Booking_Value  
✦ Payment_Method  
✦ Ride_Distance  
✦ Driver_Ratings  
✦ Customer_Ratings  

## 🧮 SQL Analysis Tasks

The following business questions were solved using SQL queries:

1. Retrieve all **successful bookings**
2. Find the **average ride distance** for each vehicle type
3. Get the **total number of rides cancelled by customers**
4. List the **top 5 customers** with the highest number of rides
5. Count rides cancelled by drivers due to **personal and car-related issues**
6. Find **maximum and minimum driver ratings** for Prime Sedan bookings
7. Retrieve rides where payment was made using **UPI**
8. the **average customer rating per vehicle type**
9. Calculate the **total booking value of successfully completed rides**
10. List all **incomplete rides with their reasons**

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard Analysis
